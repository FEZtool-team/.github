# 🌍 FEZtool  

**FEZtool** is an open-source initiative dedicated to developing cutting-edge tools for earth sciences professionals. Our mission is to empower researchers, engineers, and sustainability advocates with innovative solutions that promote environmental friendliness and sustainability.  

## 🎩 Why "FEZ"?  

The **fez** is a felt headdress, usually red with a black tassel, historically linked to the Ottoman Empire. It derives its name from the Moroccan city of **Fez**, where crimson dye for the hat was traditionally sourced. However, its origins remain debated.  

At **FEZtool**, the fez has a different meaning:  

**FEZ = Free (F) & Easy (EZ)**
